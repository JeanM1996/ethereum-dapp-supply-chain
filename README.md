### Overview
This DAPP is for a decentralized approach for certifcation schemes, issuance and verification.
Any party can become a Certifier and assign a suitable Authority that can delegate authority of certification

### Example Use Cases
Here are 3 examples to illustrate how this could work:

| Authority                         | Certifier                   | Recipient     | Inspector         |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Specialty Coffee Association       |London School Of Coffee      |Trainee Barista| Starbucks Manager |
|Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|Pymans Garage                |Car Owner      | Insurance company |
|Oracle Corporation                 |Oracle Certified Professional|Database Admin | Deutsche Bank HR  |

A Certifier would probably have a single Authority per Certificate.  Many certificates can be awarded from a scheme and potentially many "Inspectors" could request access to view one or more awarded certificates of a recipient
